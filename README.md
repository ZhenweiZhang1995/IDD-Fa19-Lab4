# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by John Q. Student*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**  
Red is power,brown is ground and orange is signal.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**  
PIN 9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**  
`pos` controls the angle. The step size in the for loop controls the speed.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
